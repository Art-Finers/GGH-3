This repository contains the work of the **ART-FINEURS** team for the [GottaGoHack](https://www.gottagohack.fr/) #3 Hackathon.


## Objectives

The **Art** reflects the world around us: it bears witness to the evolution of our societies and our ways of life. For 30 years now, **computers** have become more and more important in our lives until it has an impact on everything, even on art. 

The subject `Art Reinvented by Technology` allows you to push your creativity through three main axes :

* e-Art
* Art everywhere, All the time
* What is an artist ?

## Our Solution

Samply is a Music sample bank and platform based on [Massa's blockchain](https://massa.net/) technology.

The objective is to create a **transparent** and **decentralized** ecosystem that would allow the various actors in the world of music to be able to be remunerated correctly and fairly for their work.
